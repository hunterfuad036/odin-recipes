<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>5 fresh jalapeno peppers</li>
    <li>4 pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>¼ cup steak sauce, (e.g. Heinz 57)</li>
    <li>¼ cup minced white onion</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco™)</li>
    <li>1 pinch dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>¼ cup crushed Fritos® corn chips</li>
    <li>8 large potato hamburger buns</li>
    <li>8 slices pepperjack cheese</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat a grill for high heat. When the grill is hot, roast the jalapeno peppers until blackened on all sides. Place in a plastic bag to sweat and loosen the blackened skin. Rub the skin off, then seed if desired, and chop.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, use your hands to mix together the chopped jalapenos, ground beef, salt, pepper, egg, steak sauce, onion, hot pepper sauce, oregano, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt and Fritos®. Divide into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.</li>

<li>Grill patties for 10 to 15 minutes, turning once, or until well done. I always drink one beer, then flip, drink another beer, then remove from the grill and place on buns. Top each one with a slice of pepperjack cheese and pig out!</li>
